Additionally, depending on the kinds of tournaments you play in, you might find yourself needing the *Rewards* page. Tournaments oftentimes give out PTCGO codes or similar text based prizes, which can be distributed directly through the platform and claimed on that page. Refer to each tournament's details and possible annoucements by the organizer for more information.
