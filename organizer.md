# Introduction

The Limitless tournament platform is an online tournament management solution with tight integration for the following games:
* Pokémon TCG
* Pokémon VGC
* Digimon Card Game

Key features of the platform include:

### Decklist Submission and Analysis
Our integrated decklist submission makes it easy to collect and verify players' decklists before the tournament. You can run open decklist tournaments with completely public information, or wait until after the tournament to publish them. Based on the submitted decklists, the site automatically creates a tournament metagame analysis, tracking the performance, matchups and card counts of individual archetypes.

Besides individual tournament statistics, we are also [compiling the data from all tournaments](https://play.limitlesstcg.com/decks) on the site, which provides a great resource for both new and experienced players. In addition to that, we are working together with [Trainer Hill](https://www.trainerhill.com/), a site that uses the tournament data for even further analysis.

### First-Class Swiss System Support
The platform is built to provide the best possible support for the Swiss-system tournaments that are the standard for card games. You can add timers to the round, create multi-phase set-ups, and more. Players have a central page where they are updated about all their pairings and can drop out of the tournament if needed. There are tools use can use to detect inactive players and remove them from the tournament. 

In short, we are trying to automate all the manual tasks that often come up when running Swiss tournaments on platforms that are made for bracket-based tournaments. Of course, you can also run brackets on the site—both in addition to Swiss rounds, and on their own.

### Tournament Series and Rankings
You can easily create rankings for a series of tournaments and keep them up to date with just the click of a button. Rankings are completely customizable and allow to track individual players' placements. Check out [this example](https://play.limitlesstcg.com/series/limitless-online-2021/ranking)!
