The Limitless tournament platform ([play.limitlesstcg.com](https://play.limitlesstcg.com/)) is a website on which you can participate in tournaments for the Pokémon TCG, Digimon Card Game, and *(newly added)* Pokémon Video Games.

The site takes care of all tasks related to tournament procedures, like generating pairings and decklist submission.

Tournament matches themselves are played through the following platforms, unless otherwise specified by the tournament organizer:
* Pokémon TCG: **[Pokémon TCG Online](https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-tcg/play-online/)**
* Digimon Card Game: **Discord / Webcam**
* Pokémon VGC: **Pokémon Sword & Shield**

Read our [quickstart guide](/player/account) to find out how to join tournaments, find your opponents, report results, and everything else you need to know! It takes less than 10 minutes to complete and will teach you all the essential information.

If you are looking to run your own tournaments on the site, check out the [organizer guides](/organizer) instead.
