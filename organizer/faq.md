# Frequently Asked Questions

## Can you add [game] to the site?

If there is enough interest, we are open to integrate other card games into the platform. If you regularly organize tournaments for a card game that is not supported by us, but would like to try out the platform, let us know.

## Do you plan to add payment integration to the site?

Currently we do not. If you want to run tournaments with an entry fee, you have to handle that externally, and restrict registration with entry codes.
